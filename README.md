### Burger SMASH full-stack app

## Heroku Link: https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/burgersmash

# Description: 
# BurgerSmash is a front- and back-end app that lets users keep track of their burger consumption as well as the names of burgers they'd like to eat in the (hopefully very near) future. When a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the left side of the page, waiting to be eaten. Each burger has a button allowing the user to update that s/he has now eaten the burger-in-question. This then moves the burger to the right side of the page. Every burger is stored in a database, eaten or not. 

## UNDER CONSTRUCTION: 
# as of Wednesday, May 27th, 2020, this app is incomplete and not functioning correctly. I will be receiving extra help to have it finished before next week, at which point everything will be updated. Note that the above Heroku link will show a message that the app is broken. 

## CURRENT PROBLEMS:
# Unable to get my seeds.sql information to show on the app, although it is present on the back-end
# Unable to get buttons functioning the way I thought they might: although new burgers *are* added on the back-end, they do not appear on the app
# Clearly, I will add styles to the app

## IMAGES:
# Notice in particular that new burgers:
# 1. do not appear on the front page of the app, but;
# 2. are given an ID that displays at an endpoint;
# 3. do not immediately appear on the back-end with seeds and other previously entered burgers;
# 4. do appear on the back-end after another burger is entered in the front, and;
# 5. that process repeats at this point.
